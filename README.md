# Multi-GPU-DNN

## Tensorflow-gpu and MirroredStrategy:

The main objective here is to run a model on multiple GPUs.
Here, I use tensorflow-gpu and MirroredStrategy API to enable this.
By default, tensorflow-gpu will only use the first gpu available.

## Model:

Traind and Tested MNIST dataset with LSTM Recurrent Neural. By default LSTM will use tanh activation function.
